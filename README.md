*Tow-Boot* installer GUI
========================

This GUI is intended to provide a user-friendly interface for installing
*Tow-Boot* on end-user devices.

This project alone is not "complete". It is a component used by the *Tow-Boot*
build system.

This GUI is intended mainly for installation on mobile devices, where the
platform firmware interface may not be available.

It is expected to run under a minimal Linux system.
